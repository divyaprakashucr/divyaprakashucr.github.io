<!--I am a Public Policy Graduate Candidate at [School of Public Policy]( https://spp.ucr.edu), [University of California, Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu). During the school year 2021-22, I worked as a Graduate Student Researcher (GSR) at [Center for Geospatial Sciences]( https://spatial.ucr.edu), UC Riverside. Starting summer 2022, I will work as a GSR for **Professor Ariel Dinar** and **Professor Mehdi Nemati**.--> 

<!--Before joining UCR, I worked as a researcher in India with the [Ministry of Commerce & Industry]( https://commerce.gov.in), [Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS)]( https://www.ris.org.in) - Ministry of External Affairs, and [JustJobs Network]( https://www.justjobsnetwork.org). I received my Master’s in Economics from [Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU)]( https://www.jnu.ac.in/node), India, and a bachelor’s degree in Economics from the [University of Delhi]( http://www.du.ac.in), India.-->  

<!--My research interests are in water resource economics, climate change, global value chains, youth employment and spatial data science.--> 

<!--specializing in water resource economics, climate change, global value chains, and spatial data science.--> 
<!--under the guidance of esteemed professors Ariel Dinar and Mehdi Nemati. This invaluable opportunity not only allowed me to expand my knowledge of environmental economics and policy but also enabled me to contribute to groundbreaking research in this field.-->

<!--During the academic year 2022-23, I have worked as a Graduate Student Researcher (GSR) on a significant project titled [Private (On-Farm), Public, and Political Adaptation to Climate-Change-Induced Water Scarcity: Evidence from California](https://waterdialogue.ucr.edu/climate-change). Previously, in the academic year 2021-22, I actively engaged in geospatial research projects as a GSR at the [Center for Geospatial Sciences at UC Riverside](https://spatial.ucr.edu). Prior to joining UCR, I have experience working with Indian organizations such as the [Ministry of Commerce & Industry](https://commerce.gov.in/), the [Research and Information System for Developing Countries](https://www.ris.org.in) (RIS), and the [JustJobs Network](https://www.justjobsnetwork.org/about-us/).--> 



Welcome! I am a Research Specialist at the [University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources (UC ANR)](https://ucanr.edu/), affiliated with the [California Institute for Water Resources (CIWR)](https://ciwr.ucanr.edu/index.cfm). My work lies at the intersection of environmental economics, agricultural sustainability, and public policy.

With a strong foundation in applied econometrics and policy evaluation, I study how farmers and institutions adapt to climate stressors such as droughts, groundwater depletion, and nutrient regulation. My research focuses on improving environmental outcomes while sustaining agricultural productivity, especially in California’s Central Valley.

Over the years, I have collaborated with the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/ext/en/home), [Center for Geospatial Sciences at UC Riverside](https://spatial.ucr.edu), [Ministry of Commerce & Industry](https://commerce.gov.in/), [Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS)](https://www.ris.org.in), and the [JustJobs Network](https://www.justjobsnetwork.org/about-us/), to advance evidence-based research on labor markets, land use, water quality, and rural development. I have led projects across South Asia, Southeast Asia, and North America, integrating economic theory, geospatial analysis, and large-scale data.
