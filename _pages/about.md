I am a Public Policy Graduate from the [School of Public Policy]( https://spp.ucr.edu), [University of California, Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu).

Before joining UCR, I worked as a researcher in India with the [Ministry of Commerce & Industry]( https://commerce.gov.in), [Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS)]( https://www.ris.org.in) - Ministry of External Affairs, and [JustJobs Network]( https://www.justjobsnetwork.org). I received my Master’s in Economics from [Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU)]( https://www.jnu.ac.in/node), India, and a bachelor’s degree in Economics from the [University of Delhi]( http://www.du.ac.in), India. 

My research interests are in water resource economics, climate change, global value chains, youth employment and spatial data science.
