I am a Public Policy Graduate from the [School of Public Policy]( https://spp.ucr.edu), [University of California, Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu).

During the academic year 2022-23, I had the privilege of working as a Graduate Student Researcher (GSR) on a significant project titled "Private (On-Farm), Public, and Political Adaptation to Climate-Change-Induced Water Scarcity: Evidence from California," under the guidance of esteemed professors Ariel Dinar and Mehdi Nemati. This invaluable opportunity not only allowed me to expand my knowledge of environmental economics and policy but also enabled me to contribute to groundbreaking research in this field. Previously, in the academic year 2021-22, I actively engaged in geospatial research projects as a Graduate Student Researcher (GSR) at the Center for Geospatial Sciences at UC Riverside.

Prior to joining UCR, I gained valuable research experience in India, working with organizations such as the Ministry of Commerce & Industry, the [Research and Information System for Developing Countries](https://www.ris.org.in) (RIS) under the Ministry of External Affairs, and the [JustJobs Network](https://www.justjobsnetwork.org/about-us/). These roles provided me with extensive exposure to a wide range of topics, including trade policy, industry analysis, and employment challenges in developing countries.

I hold a master’s degree in economics from Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), India, where I specialized in the world economy. Additionally, I earned my bachelor’s degree in economics from the University of Delhi, India.

With a strong passion for interdisciplinary research and a focus on utilizing spatial data science to address complex policy issues, I am committed to contributing to evidence-based decision-making and promoting sustainable and inclusive development. Through my academic and professional journey, I have developed expertise in data analysis, statistical modeling, and research methodology.
